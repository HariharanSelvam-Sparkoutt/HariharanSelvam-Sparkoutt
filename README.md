Hello there! I'm Hariharan, a dedicated professional with a background in Mechanical Engineering and experience as a Junior Field Officer in the Finolex Plasson Industries Private Limited. I've always been fascinated by technology and its transformative power, which has led me to embark on an exciting career transition into web development.

Interning as a Software Developer Trainee at SparkOutTech Solutions was an enriching journey that allowed me to delve into the realm of real-world software development projects, with a particular focus on refining my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
